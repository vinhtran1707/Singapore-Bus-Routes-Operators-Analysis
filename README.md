# Singapore-Bus-Routes-Operators-Analysis
Geospatial analysis of Singaporeâ€™s bus network using LTA open data. Visualizes bus stop coverage, operator overlap, and number of services per stop with ggplot2. Demonstrates data wrangling, mapping, and competitive transport insights using R (dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, viridis).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project performs **geospatial analysis and visualization** of Singaporeâ€™s bus network using data from the **Land Transport Authority (LTA)**.  
It explores how **different bus operators** share stops, how many **bus services** pass through each stop, and provides **visual insights** into Singaporeâ€™s transport network.

The project demonstrates practical use of:
- **Data wrangling** with `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- **Geospatial visualization** with `ggplot2`
- **Competitive / coverage analysis** across operators
- **Data storytelling** using public transport infrastructure data
